# Authentication Zero

The purpose of authentication zero is to generate a pre-built authentication system into a rails application (web or api-only) that follows both security and rails best practices. By generating code into the user's application instead of using a library, the user has complete freedom to modify the authentication system so it works best with their app.

## Installation

```
$ bundle add authentication-zero
```

## Usage

```
$ rails generate authentication
```

## Developer responsibilities

Since Authentication Zero generates this code into your application instead of building these modules into the gem itself, you now have complete freedom to modify the authentication system, so it works best with your use case. The one caveat with using a generated authentication system is it will not be updated after it's been generated. Therefore, as improvements are made to the output of `rails generate authentication`, it becomes your responsibility to determine if these changes need to be ported into your application. Security-related and other important improvements will be explicitly and clearly marked in the `CHANGELOG.md` file and upgrade notes.

## Features

### Essential

- Sign up
- Email and password validations
- Checks if a password has been found in any data breach (--pwned)

- Verify email using a link with token
- Ask password before sensitive data changes, aka: sudo (--sudoable)
- Reset the user password and send reset instructions
- Reset the user password only from verified emails
- Lock mechanism to prevent email bombing (--lockable)
- Rate limiting for your app, 1000 reqs/minute (--ratelimit)
- Send e-mail confirmation when your email has been changed
- Manage multiple sessions & devices
- Activity log (--trackable)
- Log out

### More

- Social login with omni auth (--omniauthable)
- Passwordless authentication (--passwordless)

- "Sign-in as" button (--masqueradable)
- Multi-tentant application (--tenantable)

## Generated code

- [has_secure_password](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/SecurePassword/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_secure_password): Adds methods to set and authenticate against a bcrypt password.
- [signed cookies](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Cookies.html): Returns a jar that'll automatically generate a signed representation of cookie value and verify it when reading from the cookie again.
- [httponly cookies](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Cookies.html): A cookie with the httponly attribute is inaccessible to the JavaScript, this precaution helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- [signed_id](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/SignedId.html): Returns a signed id that is tamper proof, so it's safe to send in an email or otherwise share with the outside world.
- [current attributes](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/CurrentAttributes.html): Abstract super class that provides a thread-isolated attributes singleton, which resets automatically before and after each request.
- [action mailer](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html): Action Mailer allows you to send email from your application using a mailer model and views.
- [log filtering](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#log-filtering): Parameters 'token' and 'password' are marked [FILTERED] in the log.
- [functional tests](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#functional-tests-for-your-controllers): In Rails, testing the various actions of a controller is a form of writing functional tests.
- [system testing](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#system-testing): System tests allow you to test user interactions with your application, running tests in either a real or a headless browser.

### Sudoable

Use `before_action :require_sudo` in controllers with sensitive information, it will ask for your password on the first access or after 30 minutes. You should replace the default current password fields with this approach.

### Tenantable

Some artifacts are generated in the application, which makes it possible to implement row-level multi-tenancy applications. You should follow some steps to make it work.

- Add `account_id` to each scoped table, ex. `rails g migration projects account:references`.
- Add `include AccountScoped` to scoped models. It set up the relationship with the account and default scope using the current account.
- The `Current.account` is set according to the first parameter in the url ex: `http://mywebsite.com/1234/projects`.
- You should customize the authentication flow yourself, we just provide methods that you can use, it means:
  - Add the `account_id` column and scope the user model.
  - Assign a new account to user on sign-up.
  - After sign-in redirect to the correct url, including the `account_id`.

## Development

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
